Summary of activities undertaken this week (minimum 90 words, maximum 110 words)

Summary:
We had our first look at the Arduino IDE and boards. We also installed Python for use in future labs. We used an example program to make a LED blink on and off repeatedly, at custom frequencies. We then set off to create code to make a LED show either green, blue or red. We iterated on this code to make the lights flash on in accordance to a bitwise clock. We then iterated again on this code, to make it work in very specific conditions, with the help of a counter.

Summary of planned activities for next week (minimum 90 words, maximum 110 words)

Summary:
For week 2 we plan to go back over Week Oneâ€™s content and understand the code we have written. We will also spend time familiarising ourselves with the coding template provided via email and apply it to previously written code of value.
In accordance with the schedule, we will be spending time understanding the system start-up of Arduino Uno. We will also be spending some time researching how to interface the OLED display, along with text and graphics. This coupled with improving our knowledge of serial data I/O, especially focusing on PC communication will be our goals for the week 2 lab.
