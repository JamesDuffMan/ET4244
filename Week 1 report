Summary of activities undertaken this week (minimum 90 words, maximum 110 words)

Summary:
We had our first look at the Arduino IDE and boards. We also installed Python for use in future labs. We used an example program to make a LED blink on and off repeatedly, at custom frequencies. We then set off to create code to make a LED show either green, blue or red. We iterated on this code to make the lights flash on in accordance to a bitwise clock. We then iterated again on this code, to make it work in very specific conditions, with the help of a counter.
