Summary of activities undertaken this week (minimum 90 words, maximum 110 words)

Summary:
This week we began working on python scrips for the first time, using the Arduino uno and the IDLE interface. We first checked the code to ensure that it was working as intended and noticed that sometimes our altitude would become negative. Having noted this bug and logging it for the final report we moved on to the python scrips. Our goal was to have python automatically read in values from the com port that the uno was connected to and auto output the results to a text file. With the help of Ian and the associated python website we were able to automate the collection of data and have it all save locally in a text file.

Summary of planned activities for next week (minimum 90 words, maximum 110 words)

Summary:
In the following sessions, we will connect our microprocessor to the PC to make and test our interface with Arduino serial monitor. For this we will use Python for set-up serial communications. We will test if it works and correct errors if necessary.

In the next part, to be able to have more samples and to be able to contrast and study the results better, we will take 25 measures. Five measures in the five places chosen in the previous practices. With these new results we can improve our program.
