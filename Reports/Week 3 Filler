In preparation for week 4's session, we of group 4 have been experimenting with Arduino. We have been searching online at Adafruit libraries and GFX files to see just creative we can get when using the oled monitor. In the week 3 lab we discovered that our code was hidden behind a splash screen. In the days leading up to the next lab slot we plan discover as to why this is happening and to come up with a remedy. 
Outside of Arduino we will explore the university campus and come up with potential areas to set up our final project.
