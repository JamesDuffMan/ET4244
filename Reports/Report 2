Summary of activities undertaken this week (minimum 90 words, maximum 110 words)

Summary:
In the first part of this laboratory, we have install the library of arduino’s screen. We have tried the examples codes but we had had many problems because in the screen we can’t see clearly the cartoons. We have installed several programs but finally we have achieved this by changing some lines of program code.
