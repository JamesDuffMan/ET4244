Summary of activities undertaken this week (minimum 90 words, maximum 110 words)

Summary:
This week classes were cancelled due to open days, with the task being assigned to us being to plan the individual project report. Over the past week we have had two group meetings in which we carefully planned out the project report. We spent time discovering a structure and took steps towards familiarising ourselves with the IEEE citation style for the references.
